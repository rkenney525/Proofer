Proofer
=======

Proofer is a logic engine designed to help the user prove an argument to be valid.  The "help" is simply disallowing the user to use rules incorrectly.  The interface is the command line, but if I ever get ProoferGame working how I like it then the interface will be much more enjoyable (hence the appended 'game').
